          I'm a full stack engineer with experience developing complex web applications
          comprehensive of front-end, back-end and deployment.
          I specialize in JavaScript, working in agile environments and leveraging modern
          technologies like React.js, Redux, Node.js.
          I also don't mind to work with Java Spring in which I am experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lately I have been developing the front-end of an IOT system which
          empower the users through FIWARE, a framework for smart solutions.
